Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency, a virtual currency designed to act as money and a form of payment outside
the control of any one person, group, or entity, thus removing the need for third-party involvement in
financial transactions. It is rewarded to blockchain miners for verifying transactions and
can be purchased on several exchanges.

Bitcoin's Blockchain Technology

Cryptocurrencies are part of a blockchain and the network required to power it. 
A blockchain is a distributed ledger, a shared database that stores data. 
Encryption methods secure data within the blockchain. 
When a transaction takes place on the blockchain, information from the previous block is copied to a new block with the new data, 
encrypted, and validators verify the transaction—called miners—in the network. 
When a transaction is verified, a new block is opened, and a Bitcoin is created and given as a reward to the miner(s) 
who verified the data within the block—they are then free to use it, hold it, or sell it.

Bitcoin uses the SHA-256 hashing algorithm to encrypt the data stored in the blocks on the blockchain. 
Simply put, transaction data stored in a block is encrypted into a 256-bit hexadecimal number. 
That number contains all the transaction data and information linked to the blocks before that block.

To use your Bitcoin, you need to have a cryptocurrency wallet. 
Wallets hold the private keys to the bitcoin you own, which need to be entered when conducting a transaction. 
Bitcoin is accepted as a means of payment for goods and services at many merchants, retailers, and stores.

Brick-and-mortar stores that accept cryptocurrencies will generally display a sign that says “Bitcoin Accepted Here”; 
the transactions can be handled with the requisite hardware terminal or wallet address through QR codes and touchscreen apps. 
An online business can easily accept Bitcoin by adding this payment option to its other online payment options: credit cards, PayPal, etc.
