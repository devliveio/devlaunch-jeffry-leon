Here are some tips for brushing your teeth:
Time: Brush your teeth for at least two minutes or 120 seconds.
Toothpaste: Use a pea-sized amount of fluoride toothpaste on a dry toothbrush.
Technique: Gently move the brush in short circular strokes at a 45-degree angle to your gums:
Outer surfaces: Start with the outer surfaces of your upper teeth, then your lower teeth. Make sure to reach the back teeth.
Inner surfaces: Use the same circular motion to brush the inside surfaces of all your teeth. For the front teeth, tilt the brush vertically and make several up-and-down strokes.
Chewing surfaces: Scrub the chewing surfaces of your teeth, especially the grooves in your back teeth. Use the tip of the toothbrush in a circular motion to clean the front teeth.
Tongue: Brush your tongue for fresher breath.
When to brush: Brush your teeth twice a day, but avoid brushing immediately after eating because your mouth is more acidic and brushing can be harmful.
